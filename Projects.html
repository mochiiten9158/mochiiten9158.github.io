                <h2>Projects/Papers</h2>
                <p>Below are some projects that I have worked on.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><b>Race Between Two Campuses : </b>A two-player game made entirely in Java. The game was based on a classic chutes and ladders gameboard where the players begin
                        from the starting point at the Mies Campus and roll a dice (determined by means of a random integer generator) and the player moves across the board in a winding fashion. 
                        The winner is the player who reaches the end point, the Downtown Campus, first.</p><p>I was responsible for coding for the edge cases, mainly tying the various classes
                        into the main method that runs the game, and coding for exceptions so that the players do not fall of the map. I also contributed greatly in the coding of the gameboard
                        and creating the object for the same that would refresh each time the game was run.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Real Friends Vs. Virtual Friends : </b>This was a term paper that I wrote while evaluating two papers written by Cocking and Matthews, and Briggle with two opposing
                        stands on whether online friends can be considered real and true or not, and what trust online looks like. I argued in favor of Briggle, stating my views for the arguement 
                        that online friends are real by highlighting the various technological advances that have made it easier to convey emotions with one another online while drawing my points 
                        in proposition from case studies of people who have found true friends online. The paper sought to evaluate how trust can be built online.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Narrative Self Constitution View : </b>This was a term paper that I wrote for the purpose of evaluating Marya Schechtman's <i>Narrative Self Constitution View</i> in her 
                        book <i>The Constitution of Selves</i>. I described NSCV and explored whether the virtual and the real may be considered the same in virtual worlds such as Second Life by giving 
                        examples of the differences between the two worlds and how the virtual world may fail on the reality constraint and the articulation constraint.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Government Investment into Natural Capital and Effects of GDP : </b>This was also a term paper where I, through means of literature review, illustrated that investment by
                        governments into natural capital such as solar energy can drive GDP growth development, and enumerated the benefits of investment into sustainable power source utilization.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) as an alternative to Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) : </b>In this paper I described the supply chain of both turbines, then by enumerating 
                        the drawbacks of the HAWT through literature review I compared it with the advantages of VAWT over HAWT and proposed a plan for the large scale manufacture of the new product and the
                        expectant initial investment required for the project, along with optimum sites throughout the US to set up such turbines, along with a tentative demand analysis.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>“Darwin’s Bulldog” and the Method of Scientific Investigation: Thomas Henry Huxley and the <br>scientific method of evolutionary developmental biology : </b>In this paper I explored
                        <br>the method of scientific inquiry, including the procedures of induction and deduction <br>as used by Huxely, and his views regarding the correlation between the various <br>branches of Philosophy
                        and science, as well as his views of agnosticism and how his beliefs in the <br>same helped him to conduct his experiments and make contributions towards science.</p></li>
