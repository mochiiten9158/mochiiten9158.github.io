                            In Accelerated Introduction to Computer Science, I helped develop a game entirely in Java where I coded for the edge cases and designed and coded for the main 
                            class that ran the game classes together. I also participated in the testing and debugging of our game. 
                            I also know how to code for data structures in Java by virtue of the lab work in the course. 
                            My projects can be found on <a href="https://github.com/mochiiten9158">Github</a>.</p></li>
