            <section id="salutation_and_introduction">
                <h2>Hi! My name is Shambhawi Sharma.</h2>
                <p>My name "Shambhawi" is derived from the Sanskrit word 'सम्भवम्' (<i>saṃbhavam</i>) meaning the "one who descends by their own will" in keeping with my difficult birth and strong will to survive. It is in the spirit of my name 
                that I hope to be resilient in any circumstance and be diligent in my work. My family name 'Sharma' is an ancient and prestigious name that is derived from the Sanskrit word "शर्मन्" (<i>ṣárman</i>) meaning "comfort" and "joyfulness".</p>
                <p>I was born on October 17, 2002 in a little city called Navi Mumbai located in the middle of fog-covered forested 
                hills and the sea in the Indian state of Maharashtra. However, I grew up in a nearby city called Pune, a green city that's most breathtaking during the rainy months from June to December. I attended St. Mary's School from kindergarten 
                up till high school.</p>

            <section id="hobbies">
                <p>Some of my hobbies and interests are as follows.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><b>Music : </b>I have been trained from a very young age in the traditional art of music in my culture. I know how to play the traditional hand cymbals, called the <i>manjīrā</i>, the Indian bamboo flute called the 
                    <i>vaṃśi</i>, and the Chinese zither <i>guzheng</i>. Outside of traditional instruments, I also play the guitar. I am also an excellent singer and have done solo as well as choir performances both at school as well as in my 
                    community.</p>
                    <p>Apart from playing music myself, I enjoy listening to classical music (Tschaikowsky, Vivaldi and Li Xiangting) as well as rock music (my favorite rock band is a Japanese rock band called Ling Tosite Sigure). Besides this, 
                    I have recently become deeply invested in the music composed by Yu-Peng Chen and HoyoMix for the video game <i>Genshin Impact</i>. I find the music to be a perfect blend of modern instrumentalism along with traditional sounds of the region
                    it depicts in game.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Dance : </b>I have been trained from the age of six in Manipuri dance. However, it is a dance form that is exclusively performed in temples, and hence, in honor of my teacher, I have not participated in any staged
                    performances of the dance. Manipuri dance is famous for its fluid hand movement and graceful footwork, along with its colorful costumes that are a signature of the North-East region of India. It usually depicts the <i>rāsa-līlā</i>, 
                    the divine dance under the moonlight of Lord Krishna and Sri Radha in the forests of Vrindavan in North India. However, other pastimes of the Lord, including his childhood stories, are also depicted along with the tune of cheerful 
                    music to the beats of the pung and cymbals native to the region of Manipur.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Literature : </b>I greatly enjoy reading as well as writing. I am deeply invested in the poetic works of Romantic Age poets like Percy Shelley and Sir William Wordsworth, as well as Victorian age poets like Alfred Lord 
                    Tennyson and Matthew Arnold. My all time favorite poems include Crossing The Bar (Tennyson), Ode To The West Wind (Shelley) and Dover Beach (Arnold). I find the symbolism in these poems to be profound and I often see some of the lines relate
                    to me in some way. I have read several novels and plays by Nikolai Gogol and Anton Chekov. I was extremely impressed by one of Chekov's short stories- <cite>The Bet (1889)</cite></p>
                    <p>Apart from reading literary works I myself write quite a bit. My preferred style may be loosely described to be heavily reliant on metaphors and personificaions of nature. </p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Video Games : </b>I enjoy playing video games a lot, such as League of Legends, Genshin Impact, Resident Evil, Final Fantasy and more recently, Ghostwire: Tokyo. Apart from playing games, I also hope to build my own and hence I self-
                    learnt Unity 3D which is an excellent game development platform.</p></li>
